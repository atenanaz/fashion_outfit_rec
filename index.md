The MMTF-14K dataset provides a stable and extensive source for devising and evaluating movie recommender systems. Unlike other datasets, MMTF-14K contains <strong><a href="https://mmprj.github.io/mtrm_dataset/datasets">audio and visual descriptors</a></strong> in addition to ratings and metadata for 13,623 Hollywood-type movie trailers. The dataset therefore facilitates research on content-based recommender systems, where content refers not only to metadata, but specifically to visual and auditory characteristics of movies. We also provide several baseline <a href="https://mmprj.github.io/mtrm_dataset/benchmark" target="_blank">benchmarking results</a> for uni-modal and multi-modal recommendation systems. In addition to recommendation, the dataset also supports the exploration of other multimedia tasks such as popularity prediction, genre classification, or auto-tagging (aka tag prediction).



The MMTF-14K dataset has been created as a joint research work by <a href="http://www.ir.disco.unimib.it/yashar-deldjoo/" target="_blank"> Yashar Deldjoo </a> (Politecnico di Milano, Italy), <a href="http://www.campus.pub.ro/lab7/gconstantin/" target="_blank">Mihai Gabriel Constantin </a> and <a href="http://campus.pub.ro/lab7/bionescu/" target="_blank">Bogdan Ionescu </a>(University Politehnica of Bucharest, Romania), <a href="http://www.cp.jku.at/people/schedl/" target="_blank"> Markus Schedl </a> (Johannes Kepler University Linz, Austria), and <a href="https://scholar.google.it/citations?hl=en&user=dTSOPCMAAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate" target="_blank"> Paolo Cremonesi </a> (Politecnico di Milano, Italy).
