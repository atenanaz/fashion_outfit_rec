Building a fashion RS has characteristics that are challenging in comparison with other domains. One of the key challenges of fashion RS is linked with the fact that human decision making in the fashion domain is largely visual, which means visual appearance and characteristics of fashion items play a key role in users' affinity toward them. Another distinguishing property of fashion recommendation is that human selection choices are largely relational, signifying that the choice of one fashion item can be largely dependent on properties of another fashion item.

In this regard, this thesis explores a novel and challenging task in the context of fashion RS named fashion outfit recommendation by leveraging visual styles of fashion items. A fashion outfit is collection of fashion items e.g., a shirt, pants and shoes selected by user for a particular event or purpose for example to go to a party. Fashion outfit recommendation is different from standard fashion item recommendation since it has to model the visual relation between fashion items in a set to form a stylish outfit. In particular, fashion outfit recommendation has to tackle two main open issues, pairwise similarity between fashion items, e.g., a brown pair of shoes is similar to a brown bag in terms of color and complementariness sense of and outfit, e.g., a brown pair of shoes, a blue pair of pants with a light-colored shirt can form a stylistic outfit even visually they do not look similar (rather complementary).
