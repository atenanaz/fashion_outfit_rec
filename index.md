The MMTF-14K dataset provides a stable and extensive source for devising and evaluating movie recommender systems. Unlike other datasets, MMTF-14K contains <b>audio and visual descriptors</b> in addition to ratings and metadata for 13,623 Hollywood-type movie trailers. The dataset therefore facilitates research on content-based recommender systems, where content refers not only to metadata, but specifically to visual and auditory characteristics of movies. We also provide several baseline <a href="https://mmprj.github.io/mtrm_dataset/benchmark">benchmarking results</a> for uni-modal and multi-modal recommendation systems. In addition to recommendation, the dataset also supports the exploration of other multimedia tasks such as popularity prediction, genre classification, or auto-tagging (aka tag prediction).
