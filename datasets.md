# Datasets
Here we will place our datasets

The <b>Audio descriptors</b> folder contains two sub-folders: <i>block-level features (BLF)</i> and <i>i-Vector features</i>. While the BLF include different fusion schemes, the i-Vector features include different parameters for the gaussian mixture model (GMM) and total variability dimension (tvDim). The BLF folder has two sub-folders: All and Component6, and while the former contains the fusion scheme of all the 6 subcomponents of the BLF, the later contains each of the 6 components in separate csv files.
