# Datasets
Here we will place our datasets

The Audio descriptors folder contains two sub-folders: Block level features and I-Vector features. While the Block-level features include different fusion schemes, the I-Vector features include different parameters for the gaussian mixture model (GMM) and total variability dimension (tvDim). The \textit{Block level features} folder has two sub-folders: All and Component6, and while the former contains the fusion scheme of all the 6 subcomponents of the BLF, the later contains each of the 6 components in separate csv files.
